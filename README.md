# replaceall.sh
replaceall.sh is a shell script that allows you to replace text in multiple files using rg and sed utilities. With this script, you can easily search for a string in all files that match a given glob pattern and replace it with a new string. You can also choose to match the search string as a whole word or as a substring.
